## Overview

The purpose of this course is to teach the design of operating systems and operating systems concepts that appear in other computer systems. Topics we will cover include concepts of operating systems, systems programming, networked and distributed systems, and storage systems, including multiple-program systems (processes, interprocess communication, and synchronization), memory allocation (segmentation, paging), resource allocation and scheduling, file systems, basic networking (sockets, layering, APIs, reliability), transactions, security, and privacy.

## Goals

- **Prepare** students for advanced courses in computer systems, e.g., distributed systems, database systems, parallel computing, by providing the necessary foundation and context.

- **Enable** students to understand the internal core logic of the operating system in depth and have a chance to design and implement their own operating systems.

- **Empower** students to write and debug large programs, design and implement useful abstractions and especially practice their ability to write and debug multi-threading programs.  


## Prerequisites

- Data structures: arrays, linked lists, binary trees, and hashing
- Assembly language programming
- The C programming language
- Debugging C using GDB
- CPU caches and memory hierarchy
- Virtual memory as covered in ICS
- CPU pipelines and basic digital logic design
- Basic knowledge of random variables and probability distributions
